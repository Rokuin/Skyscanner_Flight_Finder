# Beginner-Friendly Flight Finder Project Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Learning (2-3 weeks)
- Set up your development environment
- Learn basic Git commands
- Create a simple "Hello World" program
- Learn about web scraping basics

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (3-4 weeks)
- Implement user input collection
- Create a basic web scraper
- Store scraped data in a simple format

### Phase 3: Data Processing and Output (2-3 weeks)
- Process the scraped data
- Generate a simple CSV output
- Create basic data visualizations

### Phase 4: Improvements and Learning (3-4 weeks)
- Implement error handling
- Learn about and implement logging
- Explore ways to make your code more modular

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (2-3 weeks)
- Learn about and write basic tests
- Document your code and create a README

## 2. Beginner-Friendly Development Process

### Version Control
- Learn basic Git commands: init, add, commit, push, pull
- Use GitHub Desktop for a visual interface to Git
- Commit your changes frequently with descriptive messages

### Code Quality
- Use an IDE like PyCharm or VSCode with Python extensions
- Learn to use a linter to help you write better code
- Practice writing clean, readable code

## 3. Simplified Testing Strategy

- Start with manual testing (run your program and check the results)
- Learn to write simple unit tests for individual functions
- Gradually add more tests as you become comfortable

## 4. Documentation for Beginners

- Add comments to your code explaining what each part does
- Keep a personal "dev diary" where you note what you learn each day
- Create a simple README file explaining how to run your program

## 5. Beginner's Guide to Handling Challenges

Common challenges you might face:
1. Skyscanner's website structure changing
2. Your program running slowly
3. Getting blocked while web scraping

How to handle them:
1. Regularly check if your scraper still works, be ready to update it
2. Start with small amounts of data, learn to use Python's profiling tools
3. Add delays between requests, respect robots.txt, consider using an API if available

## 6. Learning-Focused Timeline

- Weeks 1-3: Setup and learning basics
- Weeks 4-7: Building core functionality
- Weeks 8-10: Data processing and output
- Weeks 11-14: Adding improvements, handling errors
- Weeks 15-17: Testing and documenting your project

## 7. Beginner Tips and Tricks

1. Take breaks! Coding can be intense, regular breaks help you stay focused.
2. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Use resources like Stack Overflow, Python forums, or coding Discord servers.
3. Start small and gradually add features. It's okay if your first version just gets flight data for one specific day.
4. Celebrate small victories. Successfully scraping your first bit of data is a big deal!
5. Keep learning. Each part of this project is a chance to learn something new about Python and programming.

## 8. Resources for Learning

- Python Basics: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart
- Web Scraping: "Web Scraping with Python" by Ryan Mitchell
- Git and GitHub: GitHub's own guides and tutorials
- Data Processing: "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney

Remember, it's okay to adjust this timeline as you go. Some parts might be easier for you, others might take more time, and that's perfectly normal when you're learning!
