- FR6.3: Implement retry mechanisms for web scraping failures
- FR6.4: Design the system to gracefully handle partial failures (e.g., if one module fails, others continue to function)

### 2.7 Modularity and Extensibility
- FR7.1: Design a plugin architecture to allow easy addition of new data sources beyond Skyscanner
- FR7.2: Implement a configuration system for easy customization of search parameters and system behavior

### 3.2 Usability
- NFR2.1: Provide clear user prompts for input
- NFR2.2: Display progress indicators during scraping and processing

### 3.3 Reliability
- NFR3.1: Implement error handling for network issues and unexpected data
- NFR3.2: Provide meaningful error messages to the user

### 3.4 Maintainability
- NFR4.1: Use modular design for easy updates and extensions
- NFR4.2: Include comprehensive code comments and documentation

### 3.5 Ethical Considerations
- NFR5.1: Respect Skyscanner's robots.txt and implement appropriate scraping delays
- NFR5.2: Include a disclaimer about the educational nature of the project

### 3.6 Error Handling and Resilience
- NFR6.1: The system should be able to recover from network failures without user intervention
- NFR6.2: Logs should be easily accessible and provide clear information about system state and errors
- NFR6.3: The system should maintain data integrity even in case of unexpected shutdowns

### 3.7 Modularity and Extensibility
- NFR7.1: New data sources should be addable without modifying existing code
- NFR7.2: The system should be configurable via external configuration files
- NFR7.3: Modules should have clear interfaces and minimal interdependencies

### 3.8 Documentation
- NFR8.1: Maintain comprehensive inline code documentation
- NFR8.2: Create and maintain a README file with setup and usage instructions
- NFR8.3: Document the system architecture, including module interactions and data flow
- NFR8.4: Provide user documentation explaining how to use the system effectively

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Programming Language
- Python 3.7+

### 4.2 Key Libraries
- Selenium: For web scraping
- pandas: For data manipulation

### 4.4 Output Specifications
- CSV Format: Include columns for departure date, return date, airline(s), price, duration, number of stops
- Visualizations: Price trend chart, comparison chart of top options

## 5. Constraints and Limitations
- CL1: All prices should be displayed in Japanese Yen (JPY)
- CL2: User interface and results should be in English
- CL3: Project is for educational purposes only and should not be used commercially
- CL4: Web scraping is subject to Skyscanner's website structure and may require updates if the site changes

## 6. Error Handling and Logging Specifications
- Implement a centralized logging system using Python's logging module
- Log levels should include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL
- Log files should rotate daily and be archived after a week
- Implement exception handling for all external API calls and file operations
- Create custom exceptions for application-specific error scenarios

## 7. Modularity and Plugin System
- Implement a base class for data sources that defines a common interface
- Use Python's setuptools entry points for plugin discovery
- Store plugin-specific configurations in separate YAML files
- Implement a factory pattern for creating data source objects based on configuration

## 8. Documentation Requirements
- Use Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for future contributors
- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Include diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid) in the developer guide to illustrate system architecture

## 9. Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for all modules using pytest
- Achieve at least 80% code coverage for unit tests

- Use mock objects to simulate external dependencies in tests

## 10. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- FE1: Implement multi-city trip search
- FE2: Add email notification for price alerts
- FE3: Develop a simple GUI for easier user interaction

## 11. Development Process
- Use Git for version control
- Follow a feature-branch workflow for development
- Conduct code reviews before merging changes into the main branch
- Use semantic versioning for release management

## 12. Performance Targets

## 13. Security Considerations
- Store any sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys) in environment variables
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Ensure proper error handling to avoid information leakage

## 14. Deployment
